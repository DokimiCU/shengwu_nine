Survival features:
- space suit
- sealed habitats
- health? food?



Tools:
- digging tools
- science tools
- invitro cultures (i.e. ways to keep a cell alive to study it)
- more precise gene editing. (i.e. design a cell)

Building
- doors
- chest is just a copy-paste from Exile.


Player:
- proper textures (not naked)


The Superorganism:
- need for nutrients and water (e.g. from soil, air, water. Big rewrite).
- new tissue types (e.g. roots for nutrients)
- more genes for different behaviours?
- intelligence (various ways of coordinating its behaviour, responding to environment, AI)
- communication (e.g. noise making cell type)
- entities (e.g. a cell that spawns defensive, builder, or resource gathering creatures)


Environment
- toxic atmosphere (use it to replace low cloud)
- more "spacey" sky, sun, moon
- weather
- schematic e.g. aready active structures (requires setting parameters on magpen), or dead skeletons.


More self-organising stuff:
- selfreplicating tools/buildings
- artificial neural networks



Threats:
- ???


Mission Control
- encyclopedia/newsfeed (e.g. research articles, press releases)
- communication. send and recieve messages.
- transport e.g. some method of sending samples
- gameloop for unlocking new equipment that encourages actual research rather than mindless grinding.


Performance:
- this is the kind of thing that has the potential to get out of hand and grind someone's computer to a halt. Needs things to be efficient, and to keep it within limits.
